This was my first python app that I wrote in many many years.
At first I started with a hello world, but then I decided that
learning to print hello world in the terminal wouldn't teach
me anything. So I looked up a hello world with a gui. I watched
a short video on the Tkinter library then started making my own
changes. In the end it turned out to be different program entirely.
It was a fun little project. Spent about 45 minutes on it.
